### Project Abstract

Currently, trip planning is a very time-consuming process that necessitates that travellers compare costs, durations, activities, and logistics between several sources. In this regard, we introduce Happy Journey, an AI-powered tour and recreation planner that generates structured and personalized travel itineraries. The system was built with Next.js, Clerk authentication, and Firebase for data management, integrated with the Gemini API to make context-aware recommendations. Users only need to provide basic input like budget, number of travelers, and length of the trip, and the system automatically comes up with optimized itineraries complete with destinations and all day-by-day activity plans. The innovative recreation module that links travelers with local events makes it possible for event organizers to advertise their cultural programs, exhibitions, and workshops while travelers discover the most authentic aspects of local cultures. Extensive testing in terms of unit, integration, and usability tests shows the system provides precise AI-powered recommendations, with significant reduction in manual effort while planning. This intuitive interface combined with intelligent automation makes travel itinerary creation much easier. With its focus on technological innovation together with human-centered design, Happy Journey makes trip planning smooth and enjoyable while fostering local economic development and cultural exploration.
